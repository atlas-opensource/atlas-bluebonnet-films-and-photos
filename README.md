# atlas-bluebonnet-films-and-photos
A starter app for hiring actors and creating films and photo shoots. 

This app is designed for individuals which would like to make private films that are not for resale. This app allows a user to provide payment to an actor or actress. The actor or actress in turn provides acting services to the user. The user is the film maker. The app allows for the user to not only make the film or photo but also to store it in a private film library. It further provides separate access to the actor or actress which can use the app to view the library of films that they have been paid to act in. 

This app could be expanded to allow for contractual agreements between the purchaser and the actor or actress. These could in in turn include provisions for public sale of the films and royalty payments made to the actor or actress.
