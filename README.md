# atlas-bluebonnet-films-and-photos
A starter app for hiring actors and creating films and photo shoots. 

This app is designed for individuals which would like to make private films that are not for resale. This app allows a user to provide payment to an actor or actress. The actor or actress in turn provides acting services to the user. The user is the film maker. The app allows for the user to not only make the film or photo but also to store it in a private film library. It further provides separate access to the actor or actress which can use the app to view the library of films that they have been paid to act in. 

This app could be expanded to allow for contractual agreements between the purchaser and the actor or actress. These could in in turn include provisions for public sale of the films and royalty payments made to the actor or actress. 

Another possible expansion of this app could be a third party filmer or data collector. This expanion draws on the core idea behind the "Bluebonnet Work Product" app. The Bluebonnet WP app allows employers to validate work using metadata and blockchain data. As applied here, the actor or actress ould be tasked through the app to perform a scene. The scene could then be rendered using AI based on the metadata and behavioral data the actor or actress generates while performing the scene. This update would require the film maker to purchase not only the acting services of at least one individual but also the data generated while the actor performs the scene and finaly require them to purchase the rendering service and any additions like avatars or filters. The app would then add the scene to the film maker's library of purchased scenes and alo the the actor or actresses library of scenes which they acted in.
